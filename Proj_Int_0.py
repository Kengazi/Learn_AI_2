Hello my name is Kendall and I have created a basic python class to learn Machine Learning(ML) for Data Science
- First we will strengthen your python, math, and statistical skills 
- Next basic ML statgies on datasets
- Followed by Artifical Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Then OpenCV for Image and Video Manipulation
- Lastly Object detection using Yolo and Tf-lite 

I hope to also have add some linux commands and data analysis on sensor platforms

 Modules needed :: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sci-kit learn, keras, tensorflow, pytorch, and opencv 3.#

 Dataset ::  Titanic guest, Heart rate data, Weather, Survey, MNIST Handwritten digits, MNIST Fashion, and Sensor Data

 Items Needed :: 
     - We will need a computer and a Jetson Nano or Raspberry Pi 4 with the Pi Camera v2 both will work the same in theory
     - Also if you don't have it already please download the Anaconda work station.

Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/

    I used spyder, in anaconda, to write all of the assignments and I would prefer if you also used spyder, 
    but it is okay if you use jypiter notebook I know it is very user friendly. 

    Some of the modules with be hard to install and if you are unable that use google.colab as your templete for python. 
    It is very easy to install python module on that platform
 
 Learning Assignments:: Start by running each code, so that they work on your plateform. Most of the scripts have a youtube link with information to understand. 
    Then Read the comments and understand what the code is meant to do and how it does it. Then answer the "Your turn" questions at the bottom. 
    If you are a more advance user there are harder BONUS question for you to attept to tackle.

 Week 1 - A base in using data science with python
 1.1 :: Basic Math in python and importing numpy 
 1.2 :: Definitions and Functions
 1.3 :: Complex Math in python and plotting

 Week 2 - Using Datasets
 2.1 :: Pandas DataFrames
 2.2 :: Pandas Uploading 
 2.3 :: Visual Analysis of Pandas DataFrames

 Week 3 - Linear Regression
 3.1 :: Linear Regression
 3.2 :: Multi-linear Regression
 3.3 :: Logistic Regression

 Week 4 - Machine Learning Part 1
 4.1 :: One - Hot - Encoding
 4.2 :: Decision Tree
 4.3 :: Random Forest

 Week 5 - Machine Learning Part 2
 5.1 :: SVM
 5.2 :: Naive Bayes
 5.3 :: K-means (Sci-kit)

 Week 6 - Strenthing Models
 6.1 :: K - Fold
 6.2 :: Dealing with Missing Data
 6.3 :: Gradient Descent

 Week 7 - Artificial Neural Networks
 7.1 :: ANN (Sci-kit)
 
 **** Mid - point: Compare all Algorthims ****
 
 7.2 :: ANN (Pytorch)
 7.3 :: ANN (Keras)

 Week 8 - Convolutional Neural Networks
 8.1 :: Confusion Matrix (Sci-kit)
 8.2 :: CNN (Pytorch)
 8.3 :: CNN (Keras)

 By this time you will need a camera of some-type I currently use Rasp Pi 4 and the Rasp Pi camera (successfully), a Jetson Nano will do
 
 Week 9 - Open Computer Vision
 9.1 :: Open CV: Still images
 9.2 :: Open CV: Real time video masking
 9.3 :: Open CV: Gaussian Video masking

 Week 10 - Object Detection
 10.1 :: Open CV: Haar Cascades / Face detection
 10.2 :: Open CV Yolo 
 10.3 :: TensorFlow lite

Also if you don't have it already please download the Anaconda work station.
